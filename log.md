- current results are fantastic
- target popularity is an excellent addition (slider for nicheness)
- added multiple random genre seeds (slider for diversity)
- need to add some features for mood
- honestly, need to implement some architecture before building a UI
- API request template capable of handling any parameter
- Frameworks: clustering (many sources), mood-ing (semantic analysis of a song, or toggles), 

do this:
- create df of all songs currently in library
- get all features available
- big datatable
- trends within genres
- cluster all songs from one genre
    - look for biggest grouping and query based off those values
- tensorflow
